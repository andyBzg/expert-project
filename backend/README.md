## Commit Message Convention

We follow a commit message convention to maintain a clear and organized commit history.
Below is a guide to the meaning of each commit tag:

- **build**: Changes related to the build process or external dependencies.
- **sec**: Security-related changes or vulnerability fixes.
- **ci**: Configuration changes for CI/CD and script management.
- **docs**: Updates or additions to documentation.
- **feat**: Additions of new features.
- **fix**: Bug fixes.
- **perf**: Changes aimed at improving performance.
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix errors nor add new features (code restructuring).
- **revert**: Reverting to previous commits.
- **style**: Code style changes (tabs, indentation, punctuation, etc.).
- **test**: Additions or modifications to tests.

Commit messages should be clear, concise, and follow this convention for better collaboration and
understanding of project changes.
